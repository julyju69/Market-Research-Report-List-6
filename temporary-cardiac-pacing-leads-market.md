<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporary Cardiac Pacing Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temporary cardiac pacing leads are crucial in managing patients with transient arrhythmias or during surgeries. The market is segmented into unipolar and bipolar leads. Unipolar leads have a single electrode that relies on a distant ground, often leading to broader stimulation and a higher risk of muscle twitching. Conversely, bipolar leads feature an electrode pair close together, providing more localized pacing, reducing interference with surrounding tissues, and allowing for finer control in pacing parameters.</p></p>
